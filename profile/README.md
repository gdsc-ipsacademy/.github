## üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are greatly appreciated.

- If you have suggestions for adding or removing projects, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/gdsc-ipsacademy/.github/issues/new) to discuss it, or directly create a pull request after you edit the README.md file with necessary changes.
- Please make sure you check your spelling and grammar.
- Create individual PR for each suggestion.
Please also read through the [Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/gdsc-ipsacademy/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before posting your first idea as well.
<!-- üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know? -->

## ü§î Open source - why contribute to open source?

There are many great reasons to contribute to open source projects:

- It builds your resume by demonstrating that you can collaborate with others on code.
- It gives you practice with Git and GitHub, which is a valuable computer science skill.
- It helps you to build relationships in the open source community.
- It feels good to give back to a project that you use!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Projects - which projects to contribute to?

- You can contribute to a library you currently use, because you will already understand the purpose of the library and you will be invested in making it better. You can contribute to python libraries like [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) or [scipy](https://scipy.org/) or [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) etc or javascript libraries like [react](https://react.dev/) or [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) or [polymer](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/) etc.
- You can contribute by creating your own packages, libraries and projects for the world to use.
- You can choose from a variety of ongoing projects in our organisation to contribute to according to your choise of feild. We have ongoing projects in feilds like Web Development, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Game Development, Android Developemnt, Competitive Programming and many other to come.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Creating a pull request - how to contribute?

If you are new to this, start by contributing to the project documentation, since it doesn't require writing any code. Start by finding a typo or a broken link to fix. Since this should be a simple fix, you will be able to focus on learning the contribution workflow.

If you want to contribute to someone else's project but don't have write access to the repository, you can use a "fork and pull request" workflow.
A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original ‚Äúupstream‚Äù repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.

This is a simple workflow of how contributing to a repo works:

- Create your Project Branch (git checkout -b Project/AmazingProject)
- Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingProject')
- Push to the Branch (git push origin Project/AmazingProject)
- Open a Pull Request

Please read through [How to fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) documentation for proper step by step guides on how to fork a repository.
